\begin{frame}{Advanced Write Operations (1): Atomicity}
  \begin{itemize}
      \item MongoDB write operations are atomic on the level of a document
        \inote{if two properties are update don one document nothing can happen in between}
      \item there are several so called ``write concerns''
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Guarantee that something is actually written to the database
        \item can provide different levels of guarantee
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Advanced Write Operations(2): Write concerns}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item there are four levels
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Unacknowledged
        \inote{returns immediatly}
      \item Acknowledged (default)
        \inote{write to the database then return}
      \item Journaled
        \inote{write to Journal ($=$ disk) then return}
      \item Replica Acknowledged
        \inote{write to database and backups then return}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Advanced Write Operations (3): Transactions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item sometimes more than a single operation needs to be atomic
      \inote{for example transfer money from one account to another}
    \item we want to ensure that either all or none of the operations are run
      \inote{we run them in one so-called transaction}
    \item MongoDB does this with so-called ``Bulk Write Operations''
      \inote{we do not go into details here}
  \end{itemize}
